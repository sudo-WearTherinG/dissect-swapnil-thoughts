        <p>
          Why do humans chase money? Well, to get a better lifestyle, right? But I think
          differently. I often ask myself: Why do we exist in the first place? And what happens
          after death? No one has any idea. I once asked my sister, and she said, “You’re either
          burned to dust, vaporized, or become worm food.” I said, “Yes, that’s true for the body.
          But after that... what happens?”
        </p>
        <p>
          We know death is unavoidable. You take nothing with you, and all you leave behind are the
          memories and the things you’ve gained. From here, we have two paths. One is the view my
          sister holds: that after death, there’s nothing. The other is the path Shree Krishna talks
          about: that life is a cycle, and death isn’t the end, but a transition to something
          beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m agnostic. I don’t believe in your Gods, not the ones humans created. People go there
          to beg, to ask for favors, or when they’re in financial trouble. It’s always the same:
          always asking for something, always expecting something in return. No one really goes to
          them for their presence; it’s always to make a complaint, to ask for help, or to demand
          some sort of favor. It’s like a transactional relationship; one-sided and selfish.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never asked them for anything, because I don’t believe in them that way. I don’t even
          pray to them. For me, it comes from within myself. I don’t need to fold my hands or chant
          words. I speak to them with my heart, my eyes, and my inner voice. That’s my way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord Krishna talked about life. That this human experience is temporary, an illusion,
          something to see through. He spoke about the soul, about how this body isn’t you; it’s
          just something you’re wearing for now. What matters is what’s behind it. And to find that,
          you have to look beyond your wants, your image, your attachments. Because the truth isn’t
          in what you gain, but in what you let go of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your soul keeps changing bodies. That’s what they say. But I always wondered: why? And I
          think I’ve found the answer. It’s simple, really. In a sense, both the body and the soul
          are cursed. The body suffers through the hardships of life, and the soul suffers by being
          forced to move from one body to another. Not because it wants to, but because it hasn’t
          learned how to break free or let it go...
        </p>
        <p>
          So this makes me wonder: why does this keep happening to us? If the soul doesn’t want to
          return, then why must it? Maybe it’s not punishment, but something unfinished. Something
          we keep missing. Like a loop we can’t escape because we haven’t understood the lesson. Not
          just about right and wrong, but about letting go. Of anger, of pride, of wanting. Maybe
          that’s the only way out.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe it’s not the answers we find, but the questions we learn to live with.</p>
