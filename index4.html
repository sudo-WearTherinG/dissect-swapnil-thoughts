        <span>I'm Chasing Meaning, Not Money.</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        Why do humans chase money? Well, to get a better lifestyle, right? But I think differently.
        I often ask myself: Why do we exist in the first place? And what happens after death? No one
        has any idea. I once asked my sister, and she said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre either burned to dust,
        vaporized, or become worm food.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs true for the body. But after that...
        what happens?‚Äù
      </p>

      <p>
        We know death is unavoidable. You take nothing with you, and all you leave behind are the
        memories and the things you‚Äôve gained. From here, we have two paths. One is the view my
        sister holds: that after death, there‚Äôs nothing. The other is the path Shree Krishna talks
        about: that life is a cycle, and death isn‚Äôt the end, but a transition to something beyond.
      </p>

      <p>
        I‚Äôm agnostic. I don‚Äôt believe in your Gods, not the ones humans created. People go there to
        beg, to ask for favors, or when they‚Äôre in financial trouble. It‚Äôs always the same: always
        asking for something, always expecting something in return. No one really goes to them for
        their presence; it‚Äôs always to make a complaint, to ask for help, or to demand some sort of
        favor. It‚Äôs like a transactional relationship; one-sided and selfish.
      </p>

      <p>
        I never asked them for anything, because I don‚Äôt believe in them that way. I don‚Äôt even pray
        to them. For me, it comes from within myself. I don‚Äôt need to fold my hands or chant words.
        I speak to them with my heart, my eyes, and my inner voice. That‚Äôs my way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lord Krishna talked about life. That this human experience is temporary, an illusion,
        something to see through. He spoke about the soul, about how this body isn‚Äôt you; it‚Äôs just
        something you‚Äôre wearing for now. What matters is what‚Äôs behind it. And to find that, you
        have to look beyond your wants, your image, your attachments. Because the truth isn‚Äôt in
        what you gain, but in what you let go of.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your soul keeps changing bodies. That‚Äôs what they say. But I always wondered: why? And I
        think I‚Äôve found the answer. It‚Äôs simple, really. In a sense, both the body and the soul are
        cursed. The body suffers through the hardships of life, and the soul suffers by being forced
        to move from one body to another. Not because it wants to, but because it hasn‚Äôt learned how
        to break free or let it go...
      </p>

      <p>
        So this makes me wonder: why does this keep happening to us? If the soul doesn‚Äôt want to
        return, then why must it? Maybe it‚Äôs not punishment, but something unfinished. Something we
        keep missing. Like a loop we can‚Äôt escape because we haven‚Äôt understood the lesson. Not just
        about right and wrong, but about letting go. Of anger, of pride, of wanting. Maybe that‚Äôs
        the only way out.
      </p>

      <p>Maybe it‚Äôs not the answers we find, but the questions we learn to live with.</p>
