        <span>Experience vs Expectation.</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        Look, people see the world through two lenses. One: what they’ve been through; their own
        struggles, their own scars, their own bullshit. Two: what they expect of others, the
        checklist box they shove you into before they even know your name.
      </p>
      <p>
        You either earn or you don’t. If you earn, you’re in the game. If you don’t? You’re a leech,
        a burden, a waste. Simple. No room for anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see the ones who chase the loud trophies; the house, the car, the brand, the constant
        grind for more. They brag and hustle like the world’s about to end if they don’t win this
        rat race today. But behind the curtains, you see the exhaustion. The quiet desperation when
        no one’s watching. The yawns in meetings that never end. The hollow laughs at parties that
        don’t reach the eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then there are those who checked out early from this. They didn’t care about the
        scoreboard at all. They watched the madness, detached, knowing this system was never made
        for them. They weren’t impressed by love, wealth, status, or noise. Those people were
        invisible to most because they didn’t play the game loud enough to be noticed.
      </p>
      <p>
        People get born, choose to stay, and start living the script. Then there are those who watch
        it all from the sidelines, never really stepping into the dance. If I find someone like
        that, someone who sees the strings behind the puppet show, I want to know everything about
        them. Because when they trust you, they don’t hide. They share everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here’s the thing, life isn’t about what you’ve stacked on paper or on Instagram. It’s
        about how you see the world. How you process the noise, find meaning in the chaos, or don’t.
        Achievements? Just static in the background. The real story is how your mind navigates the
        madness.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world demands you buy the package: a life scripted to chase money, titles, family, the
        next shiny thing. “You want that life,” it says, “or what’s the point?”
      </p>
      <p>
        But what if you don’t want that? What if the idea of owning more things, climbing the
        ladder, pretending to want more feels like a trap you refuse to fall into? What if you’re
        not here for trophies or hashtags or shallow validation?
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t want their noise. I want the silence beneath. The peace behind chaos. Meaning behind
        life. Freedom from pretending having means being.
      </p>

      <p>
        And then there are people like me. The ones who look at the script before jumping into the
        game and ask, What is this life?
      </p>
      <p>
        All you have to give is wealth, status, material bullshit? What about purpose? If the 9-to-5
        grind is just survival, then where the hell is the time to find what you actually exist for?
      </p>
      <p>
        Your brain is capable of so much: creativity, thought, fire, but no one asks the real
        question. Why do you exist? Instead, you’re trained to chase the next paycheck like a
        hamster on a wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because you were never taught to ask that question, it would feel meaningless, dangerous
        even. They know how your brain thinks, how to keep it busy, distracted, controlled. Control
        breeds dominance, and they want to own the narrative, the hustle, your very thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>That’s not living. That’s just running a program someone else wrote for you.</p>

      <p>
        So yeah, I’m still here in their world, but I’m watching, running my own code. Slower,
        sharper, quieter.
      </p>
      <p>
        When they ask, “What do you do? How much do you make?” I don’t have to answer. Because I’m
        tired of this game where meaning hides beneath paychecks and plastic smiles.
      </p>
      <p>I want my own life. And that’s already a revolution.</p>
      <p>
        Look, I had the comfort most don’t, dad’s money, a roof over my head, food on the table.
        Could’ve easily slipped into drugs, parties, meaninglessness like so many do. But I didn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took the comfort and turned it into my lens. Watching. Observing. Detaching. Learning. Not
        wasted, just paused; seeing the world for what it really is while everyone else runs on
        first alarm.
      </p>
      <p>
        How many of you actually said, god damn, "I will have to read all this?" But you’ll have no
        problem holding on to your phone and scrolling for 10 hours straight.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m not bragging. Just saying: you don’t have to burn out chasing what burns you. You can
        step back and see the game. Understand it. And maybe, just maybe, rewrite the rules.
      </p>

Breadcrumb #10:
Two lenses see others only by their struggles and earning.  
But the third?  
It sees the thinkers, philosophers, questioners,  
nihilists watching chaos unfold.  
They’re not here to stay—they know when to leave,  
just taking notes on the noise below  
while they drown in their own existence,  
wearing smiles as masks,  
while deeply caring for the connections they left behind.  
People like me.
