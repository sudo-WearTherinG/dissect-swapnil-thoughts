          <span>Trapped in a System Built by Them, For Them!</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          These people keep asking me, “Why don't you have a job?” And I just smile, because if I
          speak, they won't get it. Still, let me say it for once.
        </p>
        <p>Why don't you ask yourself, “Why am I living like this?”</p>
        <p>Let me break it down.</p>
        <p>You wake up at 6 or 7 a.m. Take a bath in a hurry, eat something, and then it begins.</p>
        <p>
          Run to catch a rickshaw. Fight to get in the train. Stand like cattle. Reach the office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Work like a machine from dawn to dusk. The same typing, the same files, the same endless
          routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your time, your skills, your mental peace. All sold to a company that doesn't even
          remember your name properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          After work, again the same routine. Train, rickshaw, traffic, noise. Reach home at 8 or 9
          p.m. Eat. Watch TV for 30 minutes. Sleep.
        </p>
        <p>And then repeat.</p>
        <p>This is not life. This is a trap.</p>
        <p>And what do you have to show after 20 or 30 years of this?</p>
        <p>
          A second-hand car? A 1BHK flat with EMI running till you're 60? Maybe a fridge, a cooler,
          a TV bought on discount.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't own your time. Your body is tired. Your dreams? Forgotten. You just become
          someone who's “doing his duty.”
        </p>
        <p>That's the reward? For decades of sacrifice?</p>
        <div class="section-divider">
          <span>Mother's script</span>
        </div>
        <p>And this loop isn't just for men. Women have a script too.</p>
        <p>
          Wake up before everyone, cook for husband and kids, pack tiffin. Clean. Drop kids. Do
          housework. Serve lunch. Maybe rest for an hour. Then tea time, evening snacks, kids'
          homework, groceries. Make dinner. Serve husband. Clean again. Sleep.
        </p>
        <p>No weekends. No salary. No “thank you.” Just expectations.</p>
        <p>
          She does it all, for her husband, her kids, for everyone she gives her life to. And still,
          she's invisible. They take her for granted, keep her silent, like her words don't even
          exist.
        </p>
        <p>Be a “good wife,” a “good mother.” Always smiling, never tired. And repeat.</p>
        <p>They say “family is everything,” but all you do is work for them until you collapse.</p>
        <p>Nobody stops to ask, “Is she even living?”</p>
        <p>And maybe that's the cruelest truth of all; Living, but tired down to her bones.</p>
        <div class="section-divider">
          <span>From Birth - Trained to Work, Not to Think!</span>
        </div>
        <p>You're taught to survive, not to question.</p>
        <p>And the worst part?</p>
        <p>Nobody tells you the truth.</p>
        <p>Our schools don't teach how to think. They teach how to obey.</p>
        <p>
          Sit straight. Don't talk. Memorize. Pass the exam. Become a good boy, good girl, and
          later, a good worker.
        </p>
        <p>You weren’t taught to sell your time. You were taught to get a job.</p>
        <p>Like that was noble. Like that was freedom.</p>
        <p>You work to feed the rich while your fridge stays empty.</p>
        <p>You’re serving their empire while living in the slums.</p>
        <p>You keep showing up like it’ll get better. It won’t; not like this.</p>
        <p>You’re loyal to a system that would replace you tomorrow.</p>
        <p>No one teaches you about life. About mental health. About money. About freedom.</p>
        <p>
          Just: “Do your job, settle down, have kids, be thankful, and reproduce more workers, just
          like you.”
        </p>
        <p>You think getting 30k or 50k per month is success?</p>
        <p>You can barely survive on that.</p>
        <p>
          The moment you stop working, everything crumbles. That's not earning. That's being
          dependent on a monthly dose like a drug addict.
        </p>
        <p>That's what a job is for most of India. Not a career. A drug.</p>
        <p>You say, “But what else can we do?”</p>
        <p>That's the mindset they trained into you.</p>
        <p>
          That you're insignificant, easily replaced, and powerless. That if you don't follow the
          script, you'll become a failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in truth? Even if you follow the script, you're still stuck. Because they don't want
          thinkers. They want workers.
        </p>
        <p>You are replaceable.</p>
        <p>
          One leave application and they're already training someone else. Your boss won't care.
          Your company won't care.
        </p>
        <p>That desk, that system, that ID card. It's not yours. It never was.</p>
        <p>This society teaches you to live for others. Not for yourself.</p>
        <p>
          If you work too much, they call you responsible. If you rest or think different, they call
          you lazy.
        </p>
        <p>And don't get me started on the English language system.</p>
        <p>
          90% of Indian youth speak just enough English to get a job. Say “yes sir,” “mail sent,”
          “noted.” But not enough to express what they really feel inside.
        </p>
        <p>They don't learn communication. They learn survival phrases.</p>
        <p>We're taught that fluency equals intelligence. That's a lie too.</p>
        <p>
          So when people ask, “Why don't you have a job?” what they really mean is: “Why don't you
          suffer like us?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Why don't you join the line of tired souls dragging their bodies through another day, for
          a salary they hate, in a life they didn't choose?
        </p>
        <p>Because I refuse to be a machine.</p>
        <p>
          It’s broken. You know it. I’m just the one who stopped pretending. If you’re fine being
          managed, fed, and thanked for obedience; that’s your cage, not mine. You accepted it. I
          didn’t. That’s what makes us different.
        </p>
        <div class="section-divider">
          <span>We Kill Child Innocence To Raise The Adult!</span>
        </div>
        <p>This is where I introduce you to your children's cycle.</p>
        <p>
          When they're small, you let them be. Running around barefoot in dusty lanes, chasing
          pigeons, laughing over nothing. They draw on walls, break things, ask endless questions.
          You call it “masti,” and you smile.
        </p>
        <p>But the moment their fingers can hold a pencil firmly, everything changes.</p>
        <p>
          You stop calling it innocence. Now it's “focus.” You stop listening to their silly
          stories. Now it's “study time.” You stop celebrating their curiosity. Now it's “learn
          what's in the syllabus.”
        </p>
        <p>
          You sit them down and begin selling them dreams. Not their dreams, but yours. Engineer.
          Doctor. IAS. Something “respectable.”
        </p>
        <p>
          You think you're doing it out of love. But what you really did was kill the most human
          part of them. Their innocence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the house transforms into an extension of the school. Every table turns into a study
          desk, and every conversation becomes a lecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when your child comes close for a hug, it comes with fear. Because the hug might turn
          into another lecture on “How life works” or “How hard success is.”
        </p>
        <p>This is where your child learns:</p>
        <p>
          Love has conditions. Approval must be earned. Rest is laziness. And life? It's not to be
          lived. It's to be passed like an exam.
        </p>
        <p>This is how you break a free soul, and train them to become exactly what you became.</p>
        <p>You did everything they told you. Listened to your father. Followed the script.</p>
        <p>Study hard. Get a job. Get married. Have kids.</p>
        <p>Be a responsible man. Be a good husband. Don't question, just provide.</p>
        <div class="section-divider">
          <span>All the Time, But No Strength to Use It at 60-65.</span>
        </div>
        <p>Now you're retired. The world says you've earned your rest.</p>
        <p>
          But today, as you sit at the dining table, there's a noticeable stillness in the air. No
          rush. No meetings. No deadlines. Just a peaceful quiet.
        </p>
        <p>You look around.</p>
        <p>
          Your son is getting ready for office. Same tired eyes, same fast breakfast, same silence.
        </p>
        <p>Your daughter is juggling a laptop, her tea, and time. She's already late.</p>
        <p>
          And then you glance at your wife. She's aged. The lines on her face weren't there before.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same hands that once held yours now move through the morning chores. Like she's still
          on the clock.
        </p>
        <p>And suddenly, it hits you.</p>
        <p>You didn't escape anything. You just passed it down.</p>
        <p>
          You spent your life doing what your father said. And now your children are doing what you
          did.
        </p>
        <p>Same loop. Same trap. Just with faster phones and newer EMIs.</p>
        <p>You always thought one day you'd break free. Or maybe they would.</p>
        <p>But here you are. Watching your own children walk into the same machine.</p>
        <p>
          And for the first time in years, your heart feels heavy. Not for yourself, but for them.
        </p>
        <p>You want to stop them. You want to say, “This isn't living.”</p>
        <p>But you don't.</p>
        <p>Because somewhere along the way, even your voice got tired.</p>
        <p>So you just sit there… and sip your tea.</p>
        <p>And later that evening, you glance into the mirror.</p>
        <p>For a second, you don't recognize yourself.</p>
        <p>The black hair is mostly gone. The eyes are dull. The skin feels unfamiliar.</p>
        <p>
          You whisper to your reflection. After all that… what do I have? Just retirement savings?
          Where did my youth go?

        <p class="story-text">

          He slept.

          He wasn't worried about the race.
          <br />
          He didn't care what others expected.

        <p class="story-text">
          Maybe he lost the race.
          <br />
          But he chose comfort over chaos.

          Rest over pressure.
          <br />
          Peace over proving a point.

        But I see the cage they call a life,
        endless hours sold for things they buy which brings them joy, like?
        That “successful” label nobody explains.
        Dreams left to rot in silence, reason? responsibilities other then yourself.
        They accept the noise, the grind, the sacrifice.
        I refuse the script they wrote.
        Not because I’m better,
        but because I still want to choose.
        And that makes all the difference.
