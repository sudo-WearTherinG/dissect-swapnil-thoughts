        <span>Maybe The Answers I Seek Are Not Here.</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        What “Success” Means Here vs There? They say you made it if you have the car, the title, the
        lifestyle. But that’s only here. That’s success in a world built on illusions. What about
        there, in the after-life, if it’s even true? What if success for the soul isn’t about what
        you gain, but about what you no longer need? What if it’s about walking away lighter,
        emptier, freer? If you still need to hold on to something, if you’re still bound, maybe
        you’re coming back here again, until you learn to let go.
      </p>

      <p>
        And if the point of life here is just chasing comfort, power, and recognition, I want no
        part of it. The material world offers nothing worth running for anymore. I’m looking for
        something bigger, even if it costs me everything. Maybe it’s not even in this world.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you feel like everything you desire is pointless and leads to nothing real, that’s when
        the soul stops wanting and leaves with no attachments. That’s the real win.
      </p>

      <p>
        What if You’re Close to the End? Sometimes I wonder... maybe the reason I’m even thinking
        like this, questioning all of it, is because I’m close. Not close like dying, but close to
        understanding. Close to cracking the code. What if the moment you start asking “why am I
        here?” that’s when you’re finally ready to leave?
      </p>

      <p>
        I know, it might sound like a fairytale. Something that doesn’t quite fit with the reality
        we know. But there’s this feeling I can’t shake. A quiet truth, almost hidden, that makes me
        think maybe it's not all just random. Maybe the real question isn’t about what you’ve done
        in this life, but about what you’re ready to let go of. And if you think this is just a
        delusion of mine, then explain this: why do we keep gods in our homes? Why pray, offer, and
        hold onto something if none of it matters?
      </p>

      <br />

      <div class="section-divider">
        <span>Why Are You Here? Spoiler: They Decided</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        There’s only one way into this world. You’re born without choosing, thrown into a world
        already running, already decided. They hand you a name, teach you how to sit, smile, obey.
        And before you even understand what you are, they’ve already mapped out your life: school,
        job, marriage, bills, maybe a vacation or two if you’re lucky, then die quietly. That’s what
        they call normal.
      </p>

      <p>
        But why does normal feel so hollow? Why are there a thousand ways to leave this world but
        only one way to enter it? Why does waking up every day feel like playing a part you never
        auditioned for? And deep down, why does everything feel like survival, not living?
      </p>

      <p>
        You scroll, you work, you laugh when you’re supposed to, but it’s like something real is
        missing. And no one talks about it. Maybe that’s why we pray. Not because we’re devout, but
        because some part of us is tired. Tired of pretending this is enough. Tired of not knowing
        if it ever gets better. Tired of being here and not knowing why.
      </p>

      <p>Tell me, why do you exist other than following a script which they handed you?</p>

      <p>One question. One answer. One life. One soul.</p>

  We know we are born into this with no say.  
  But no one asked me.  
  A name, a script, a system—  
  handed over before I could even think.  
  I don’t want the life they mapped out.  
  I’m not chasing titles or comfort.  
  I’m trying to understand what this even is.  
  Maybe the answers aren’t here.  
  But I’ll keep digging anyway.  
  My questions make people uncomfortable.  
  Like I’m pulling at threads they’ve taped over.  
  I shared my these pages with other's
  they read it, then vanished.  
  Like I said too much,  
  or reminded them of what they avoid.  
  so why they have no problem asking me,
  why don't I have a job?
