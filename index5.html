        <p>
          What “Success” Means Here vs There? They say you made it if you have the car, the title,
          the lifestyle. But that’s only here. That’s success in a world built on illusions. What
          about there, in the after-life, if it’s even true? What if success for the soul isn’t
          about what you gain, but about what you no longer need? What if it’s about walking away
          lighter, emptier, freer? If you still need to hold on to something, if you’re still bound,
          maybe you’re coming back here again, until you learn to let go.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if the point of life here is just chasing comfort, power, and recognition, I want no
          part of it. The material world offers nothing worth running for anymore. I’m looking for
          something bigger, even if it costs me everything. Maybe it’s not even in this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you feel like everything you desire is pointless and leads to nothing real, that’s
          when the soul stops wanting and leaves with no attachments. That’s the real win.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if You’re Close to the End? Sometimes I wonder... maybe the reason I’m even thinking
          like this, questioning all of it, is because I’m close. Not close like dying, but close to
          understanding. Close to cracking the code. What if the moment you start asking “why am I
          here?” that’s when you’re finally ready to leave?
        </p>
        <p>
          I know, it might sound like a fairytale. Something that doesn’t quite fit with the reality
          we know. But there’s this feeling I can’t shake. A quiet truth, almost hidden, that makes
          me think maybe it's not all just random. Maybe the real question isn’t about what you’ve
          done in this life, but about what you’re ready to let go of. And if you think this is just
          a delusion of mine, then explain this: why do we keep gods in our homes? Why pray, offer,
          and hold onto something if none of it matters?
        </p>

          <span>Why Are You Here? Spoiler: They Decided</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          There’s only one way into this world. You’re born without choosing, thrown into a world
          already running, already decided. They hand you a name, teach you how to sit, smile, obey.
          And before you even understand what you are, they’ve already mapped out your life: school,
          job, marriage, bills, maybe a vacation or two if you’re lucky, then die quietly. That’s
          what they call normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why does normal feel so hollow? Why are there a thousand ways to leave this world but
          only one way to enter it? Why does waking up every day feel like playing a part you never
          auditioned for? And deep down, why does everything feel like survival, not living?
        </p>
        <p>
          You scroll, you work, you laugh when you’re supposed to, but it’s like something real is
          missing. And no one talks about it. Maybe that’s why we pray. Not because we’re devout,
          but because some part of us is tired. Tired of pretending this is enough. Tired of not
          knowing if it ever gets better. Tired of being here and not knowing why.
        </p>
        <p>Tell me, why do you exist other than following a script which they handed you?</p>
        <p>One question. One answer. One life. One soul.</p>

        Breadcrumb #6:
        We know we are born into this with no say.
        But no one asked me.
        A name, a script, a system
        handed over before I could even think.
        I don’t want the life they mapped out.
        I’m not chasing titles or comfort.
        I’m trying to understand what this even is.
        Maybe the answers aren’t here.
        But I’ll keep digging anyway.
        My questions make people uncomfortable.
        Like I’m pulling at threads they’ve taped over.
        I shared my these pages with other's
        they read it, then vanished.
        Like I said too much,
        or reminded them of what they avoid.
        so why they have no problem asking me,
        why don't I have a job?
