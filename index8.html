        <span>I Thought It Was Fun, Then I Asked Why.</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        There’s a strange kind of distance I live in. Not physical. Emotional. Mental. Maybe even
        spiritual. Like I was dropped into this world not to belong, but to quietly study it. I
        don’t hate it. I’m not angry. I just see it differently. And the more I observe, the clearer
        it gets. Not everyone is built for the same kind of joy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes I sit quietly and watch people scream on roller coasters. They laugh, shout, film
        it like it’s the highlight of their lives. They wait in line, pay money, call it “fun.” But
        I don’t see fun. I see controlled fear, followed by a burst of chemicals in the brain.
        Dopamine. Adrenaline. A spike. A release. That’s all it is. A biological high. It passes,
        and they go home saying it was the best part of their day.
      </p>

      <p>
        We chase these highs through lights, noise, movement, crowds. Again and again. But beneath
        it, it’s always the same reward system. Different triggers. Same loop. One person finds it
        on a ride. Another in a festival crowd. Another in shopping. I find it in silence. In music.
        In being alone. And no, that doesn’t make me sad or broken. It just means I see the
        mechanism behind the experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve never really been able to join the rush. Even when I’m physically present, my mind
        stands at a distance. While the moment is happening, I’m already questioning it. What made
        this fun? Why do we crave it? Why do we build entire weekends around chasing temporary
        spikes of joy? Is it joy at all, or just the absence of boredom?
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s where the disconnect begins. Not from hate or bitterness. Just a different wiring.
        I’ve realized I’m not built like most. I don’t crave the same things. I don’t react the same
        way. And it’s hard to explain without sounding arrogant, but I’ll say it this way.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m like caviar. You don’t know what it tastes like. Not because you're lesser, but because
        you've never needed to. Not everyone understands it, because not everyone is meant to. It’s
        salty. Quietly bitter. An acquired taste. Some get it. Some never will.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that’s fine. Because I’m not here to be understood. I’m not here to chase what others
        chase. I’ve tried that. I’ve smiled in crowded rooms, said the right words, played the role.
        But while everyone else was celebrating, I was already stepping back. Noticing how rehearsed
        it all felt.
      </p>

      <p>
        People say I overthink. That I should just let go. But I don’t think I’m overthinking. I
        think I’m simply not distracted. Most people are too caught up in the moment to see the
        pattern. I can’t not see it. My wiring is different. And once you see behind the curtain, it
        becomes impossible to unsee.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s not that I don’t feel. It’s that I feel differently. What excites others doesn’t move
        me. What gives me peace often goes unnoticed. Maybe that makes me invisible in rooms filled
        with noise. Or maybe I just prefer the silence over applause.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I watch. I observe. Not with judgment, but with clarity. While most are chasing the next
        spark, I’m standing still. Watching the system they don’t even realize they’re part of.
      </p>

      <p>I’m not detached because I’m cold. I’m detached because I’ve seen the script.</p>

      <p>I don’t live life. I simulate it.</p>

      <p>
        If you’ve made it this far, here’s a small token for you [
        <span style="color: #00cc66">goodbyehelloworld</span>
        ] , a key to this lock. But know this: there’s more hidden beneath the surface, meant only
        for those I’ve known, those who’ve shared the silence with me. For now, this is your reward.
