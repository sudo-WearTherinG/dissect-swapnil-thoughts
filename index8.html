          <span>I Thought It Was Fun, Then I Asked Why.</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          There’s a strange kind of distance I live in. Not physical. Emotional. Mental. Maybe even
          spiritual. Like I was dropped into this world not to belong, but to quietly study it. I
          don’t hate it. I’m not angry. I just see it differently. And the more I observe, the
          clearer it gets. Not everyone is built for the same kind of joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes I sit quietly and watch people scream on roller coasters. They laugh, shout,
          film it like it’s the highlight of their lives. They wait in line, pay money, call it
          “fun.” But I don’t see fun. I see controlled fear, followed by a burst of chemicals in the
          brain. Dopamine. Adrenaline. A spike. A release. That’s all it is. A biological high. It
          passes, and they go home saying it was the best part of their day.
        </p>
        <p>
          We chase these highs through lights, noise, movement, crowds. Again and again. But beneath
          it, it’s always the same reward system. Different triggers. Same loop. One person finds it
          on a ride. Another in a festival crowd. Another in shopping. I find it in silence. In
          music. In being alone. And no, that doesn’t make me sad or broken. It just means I see the
          mechanism behind the experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve never really been able to join the rush. Even when I’m physically present, my mind
          stands at a distance. While the moment is happening, I’m already questioning it. What made
          this fun? Why do we crave it? Why do we build entire weekends around chasing temporary
          spikes of joy? Is it joy at all, or just the absence of boredom?
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s where the disconnect begins. Not from hate or bitterness. Just a different wiring.
          I’ve realized I’m not built like most. I don’t crave the same things. I don’t react the
          same way. And it’s hard to explain without sounding arrogant, but I’ll say it this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m like caviar. You don’t know what it tastes like. Not because you're lesser, but
          because you've never needed to. Not everyone understands it, because not everyone is meant
          to. It’s salty. Quietly bitter. An acquired taste. Some get it. Some never will.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that’s fine. Because I’m not here to be understood. I’m not here to chase what others
          chase. I’ve tried that. I’ve smiled in crowded rooms, said the right words, played the
          role. But while everyone else was celebrating, I was already stepping back. Noticing how
          rehearsed it all felt.
        </p>
        <p>
          People say I overthink. That I should just let go. But I don’t think I’m overthinking. I
          think I’m simply not distracted. Most people are too caught up in the moment to see the
          pattern. I can’t not see it. My wiring is different. And once you see behind the curtain,
          it becomes impossible to unsee.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not that I don’t feel. It’s that I feel differently. What excites others doesn’t move
          me. What gives me peace often goes unnoticed. Maybe that makes me invisible in rooms
          filled with noise. Or maybe I just prefer the silence over applause.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I watch. I observe. Not with judgment, but with clarity. While most are chasing the
          next spark, I’m standing still. Watching the system they don’t even realize they’re part
          of.
        </p>
        <p>I’m not detached because I’m cold. I’m detached because I’ve seen the script.</p>
        <p>I don’t live life. I simulate it.</p>
        <p>
          If you’ve made it this far, here’s a small token for you [
          <span class="pass-key">goodbyehelloworld</span>
          ] , a key to this lock. What you do with it is yours alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some drift a little farther from the surface, not out of choice but instinct. They sit
          with their thoughts until they take shape, unbothered by stillness because it’s the only
          place that feels honest. This part is for them. For the minds living between questions,
          for the hearts that beat quieter than the world expects. If you’ve ever felt meaning where
          others see only moments, these fragments are yours:
