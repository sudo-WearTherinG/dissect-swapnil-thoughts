        I didn’t just end up like this.
        <br />
        <br />
        My parents fought all the time. Like it was normal. Like they liked it. Well, mostly dad. I
        was just stuck in the middle, the thing they used to hurt each other.
        <br />
        <br />
        Love, to me, never looked like hugs or kind words. It looked like silence, guilt trips, fake
        smiles at dinner. That’s what I grew up thinking love was.
        <br />
        <br />
        So yeah, maybe that’s why I overthink everything now. Why I break down every word like it’s
        a trap. Because it used to be.
        <br />
        <br />
        Still is, sometimes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Love? I loved once. When the feeling hit before the meaning did. Maybe I didn’t even fully
        get what love meant then, just a kid caught in a feeling bigger than me. Since then?
        Nothing. No repeats. No reruns. Not because I’m numb. Because I know better. I don’t want
        skin. I want soul connection. Most people are hollow in all the wrong places.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a girl ever said “I love you, Swapnil,” I’d laugh. Not to hurt her. Not because I’m
        cruel. Because I know she doesn’t even know what she’s saying. She’s not in love. She’s in
        need. Of comfort. Of fantasy. Of distraction from the emptiness she won’t admit. And I’m
        just a vessel for that lie. A placeholder. Until she finds better. That’s the kind of girl I
        can’t stand. That’s the kind of girl I don’t waste breath on. Spoiler: I’m not the reset
        button for broken hearts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going into a relationship is like giving away parts of yourself. When it breaks, you lose
        yourself. You can’t pick those pieces back up or glue them back together either. And before
        you know it, you become like them. Doing the same to someone else. Breaking them like you
        were broken. Me? I still have all my parts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because it's true. They made motherhood a product. Fatherhood a payment plan. Childhood a
        countdown. And love? Love’s just an insurance policy against loneliness now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Love, for most, is dressed-up dependency. Two people trading pieces, mistaking it for
        connection. They break themselves down just to feel held. Me? I never played that game. I
        kept my pieces. I’m still 97% me. And no, I’m not going to talk about that missing 3%.
      </p>

      <p>It’s simple.</p>

      <p>
        I didn’t grow up around love. I grew up around fights. Guilt. Silence. I learned early: love
        can be loud, sharp, and dangerous. That’s why I hold back. Why I stay distant. Why I keep
        all my pieces. Because once, I was just a kid in the crossfire.
      </p>

      <p>It’s not loneliness if I chose it.</p>

      <p>And now?</p>

      <p>Now I don’t call it trauma. I just call it... remembering.</p>

      <p>This is how trauma rewires trust and love expectations.</p>

      <p>Back then, it would’ve felt like vanishing. Now, it just feels like fading.</p>

      <p>
        I can’t do relationships. Trusting someone enough to break me? That’s a game trauma taught
        me to quit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because I don’t love a person. I love the memories the version of them that existed only
        with me. When it ends, I don’t move forward. I leave my parts behind when it breaks. I can’t
        move on from them. I like to burn in those flames.
      </p>

      <p>
        They got curious. Then they got bored. Me? I stayed. Still holding the pieces they never
        knew they left behind.
      </p>

      <p>I’m just a ghost running on coffee, long since stopped trying to be part of the living.</p>

      <p>I try to be kind to everyone so no one sees that I’m not actually here.</p>

      <p>And yeah, I still smile. Sometimes.</p>

      <p>
        I stay behind and build something they’ll never understand. For every real connection.
        Something left behind becomes something I built.

  Love means nothing to me. Really.
  It’s just noise people make to feel less alone.  
  I don’t buy it.  
  I keep my distance.  
  Trust? Broken and thrown away.  
  Smiling’s just so they see me unbothered, nothing more.
   It’s fine to be a burden, but don’t wake others up with your noise.
