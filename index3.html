          <span>Look around. What do you see?</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          A body. A fragile, decaying vessel destined to wear down, worn muscles, tired bones, and a
          mind squeezed dry by a system that doesn’t give a damn. This system? It’s an exploit
          machine, a predator dressed in smiles and contracts. Hope? That’s a joke they sell to keep
          you distracted while they drain you dry.
        </p>
        <p>
          They tell you to dream big, glossy billboards shouting promises. But every dream has a
          price tag slapped on it, glaring like a neon scar. Your emotions? They’re no longer yours.
          They’ve been hijacked, packaged, and sold as currency. Likes, follows, dopamine hits,
          everything’s a transaction. People aren’t searching for truth anymore; they’re chasing
          comfort. A soft lie that numbs the edges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noise, noise everywhere. Noise masquerading as meaning. Social feeds stuffed with hollow
          words, meaningless chatter to fill the silence of a world that forgot how to listen. Love?
          Ha. Love here is just ownership in a pretty disguise. Dependency contracts with invisible
          chains, one gives more, the other complains louder. Both trapped, circling the same damn
          loop. Work, breed, argue, die. Rinse and repeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your job? It’s designed to keep you just tired enough, tired enough not to question, not
          to fight. You shuffle papers or punch clocks until your soul feels like a ghost. Truth?
          Forget it. Filtered through ads, twisted by algorithms, warped by fragile egos desperate
          to prove they exist.
        </p>
        <p>You’re born. You’re taught how to behave.</p>
        <p>You serve the machine. You die.</p>
        <p>Roll credits.</p>
        <p>
          And me? I watch from the sidelines, detached. Why attach to a world so cold, so rigged?
          Why get tangled in a mess built to grind us down? I see the cogs turning, the lies feeding
          the hunger, the slow decay disguised as living.
        </p>
        <p>I don’t belong here. Not really. Not fully.</p>
        <p>
          Because this? This isn’t life. It’s the same old story playing on repeat, with people
          going through the motions, swallowing excuses, chasing things they’ll never really get.
          I’m just watching, keeping my distance, like a shadow in the crowd who won’t lose himself
          in a game meant to tire and trap. When everything feels like a broken record, why pretend
          it’s anything more? So I stay outside the noise, eyes open, holding on to what’s left of
          myself, done playing a part I never agreed to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look, I’m not preaching some sacred path or claiming a crown for how to live. I’m just
          saying when everything’s designed to drain you for the rest of your life, sometimes
          stepping back, detaching, is the only way to keep what’s left of yourself. Maybe that’s
          your way, maybe it’s not. But pretending to play their game? That’s the real trap. So
          yeah, call it alienation if you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          They need something to hold onto, dreams, love, titles, anything to keep you running in
          circles. Me? I’m not interested. I live off daddy’s money, sure, but I don’t waste it. No
          clubs, no drugs, no blurry nights, no fake highs to fill the silence. I spent forty rupees
          yesterday, milk and coffee. That’s all my expense is. Because how else is a coder supposed
          to make it through the night? And that milk? I gotta share it with them too. It’s not
          fair, but that’s how it is. I live quiet, sharp, simple. While they burn out chasing
          things that don’t last, I stay outside the noise. Clear. Unmoved. Watching.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not saying your way of living is wrong. It’s the path which almost all follow: work
          hard, earn, live peacefully, and then leave. That’s what most people choose. Me? I decided
          to take a step back and quietly ask why I’m here because just going through the motions
          feels like losing a part of myself. It’s a gamble on myself, uncertain and risky, but it’s
          the only choice that feels honest.
