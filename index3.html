    <div class="fade-in">
      <div class="section-divider">
        <span>Look around. What do you see?</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        A body. A fragile, decaying vessel destined to wear down, worn muscles, tired bones, and a
        mind squeezed dry by a system that doesn‚Äôt give a damn. This system? It‚Äôs an exploit
        machine, a predator dressed in smiles and contracts. Hope? That‚Äôs a joke they sell to keep
        you distracted while they drain you dry.
      </p>

      <p>
        They tell you to dream big, glossy billboards shouting promises. But every dream has a price
        tag slapped on it, glaring like a neon scar. Your emotions? They‚Äôre no longer yours. They‚Äôve
        been hijacked, packaged, and sold as currency. Likes, follows, dopamine hits, everything‚Äôs a
        transaction. People aren‚Äôt searching for truth anymore; they‚Äôre chasing comfort. A soft lie
        that numbs the edges.
      </p>

      <p>
        Noise, noise everywhere. Noise masquerading as meaning. Social feeds stuffed with hollow
        words, meaningless chatter to fill the silence of a world that forgot how to listen. Love?
        Ha. Love here is just ownership in a pretty disguise. Dependency contracts with invisible
        chains, one gives more, the other complains louder. Both trapped, circling the same damn
        loop. Work, breed, argue, die. Rinse and repeat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your job? It‚Äôs designed to keep you just tired enough, tired enough not to question, not to
        fight. You shuffle papers or punch clocks until your soul feels like a ghost. Truth? Forget
        it. Filtered through ads, twisted by algorithms, warped by fragile egos desperate to prove
        they exist.
      </p>

      <p>You‚Äôre born. You‚Äôre taught how to behave.</p>

      <p>You serve the machine. You die.</p>

      <p>Roll credits.</p>

      <p>
        And me? I watch from the sidelines, detached. Why attach to a world so cold, so rigged? Why
        get tangled in a mess built to grind us down? I see the cogs turning, the lies feeding the
        hunger, the slow decay disguised as living.
      </p>

      <p>I don‚Äôt belong here. Not really. Not fully.</p>

      <p>
        Because this? This isn‚Äôt life. It‚Äôs the same old story playing on repeat, with people going
        through the motions, swallowing excuses, chasing things they‚Äôll never really get. I‚Äôm just
        watching, keeping my distance, like a shadow in the crowd who won‚Äôt lose himself in a game
        meant to tire and trap. When everything feels like a broken record, why pretend it‚Äôs
        anything more? So I stay outside the noise, eyes open, holding on to what‚Äôs left of myself,
        done playing a part I never agreed to.
      </p>

      <p>
        Look, I‚Äôm not preaching some sacred path or claiming a crown for how to live. I‚Äôm just
        saying when everything‚Äôs designed to drain you for the rest of your life, sometimes stepping
        back, detaching, is the only way to keep what‚Äôs left of yourself. Maybe that‚Äôs your way,
        maybe it‚Äôs not. But pretending to play their game? That‚Äôs the real trap. So yeah, call it
        alienation if you want.
      </p>

      <p>
        They need something to hold onto, dreams, love, titles, anything to keep you running in
        circles. Me? I‚Äôm not interested. I live off daddy‚Äôs money, sure, but I don‚Äôt waste it. No
        clubs, no drugs, no blurry nights, no fake highs to fill the silence. I spent forty rupees
        yesterday, milk and coffee. That‚Äôs all my expense is. Because how else is a coder supposed
        to make it through the night? And that milk? I gotta share it with them too. It‚Äôs not fair,
        but that‚Äôs how it is. I live quiet, sharp, simple. While they burn out chasing things that
        don‚Äôt last, I stay outside the noise. Clear. Unmoved. Watching.
      </p>

      <p>
        I‚Äôm not saying your way of living is wrong. It‚Äôs the path which almost all follow: work
        hard, earn, live peacefully, and then leave. That‚Äôs what most people choose. Me? I decided
        to take a step back and quietly ask why I‚Äôm here because just going through the motions
        feels like losing a part of myself. It‚Äôs a gamble on myself, uncertain and risky, but it‚Äôs
        the only choice that feels honest.
