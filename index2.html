          <span>Just a Father and His Child Bonding</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          Ever thought about your dad as a child? Yes, he was a child too. Ever wondered why he goes
          through so much to provide for your demands? And he completes them without question: not
          as a responsibility, but love.
        </p>
        <p>
          You give that big wide smile when you get what you asked for, that sparkle in the eyes:
          and as boy, I'll be honest, we're suckers for it. Maybe he remembers being a kid too,
          asking his own father for small things, and now he smiles to himself when he sees you do
          the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he gets his anger out on you, remember it's not you but something happened at work
          place or maybe in train or maybe it was a small build-up of stress, somewhere. Just cut
          him some slack and don't talk back on him, he'll realize it when he cools down.
        </p>
        <p>
          He might not say “I love you” every day, but he shows it every time he quietly fixes a
          problem before you even know it existed. And all he ever asks for in return is that smile.
          That one smile that makes it all worth it.

          <span>You Were Never Meant to Be Rich</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          You spent 30, maybe 40 years of your life in that company, day in and day out, gave them
          your youth, your energy, your health: Then why aren’t you rich? Why don’t you have the
          luxury you once dreamed of: the nicer car, the bigger house, the freedom? the vacation
          home, the designer clothes? Shouldn’t loyalty pay off? Shouldn’t sacrifice come back
          around?
        </p>
        <p>
          But no, the system was never designed to make you rich. It was designed to use you like a
          cow: quiet, consistent, replaceable. The milk is your effort, your time, your sweat: and
          to them, that milk is profit. They gave you just enough to keep you working, fed you
          promises to keep you hopeful, and expected you to keep producing.
        </p>
        <p>
          They never planned to let you live well: they planned to use you well. Promotions? Just
          things to dangle in front of you to keep you going. Benefits? Just enough to stop you from
          getting tired or quitting. And when you can’t work anymore, they don’t thank you. They
          don’t honour you. They give you a small pension, maybe a handshake, and forget about you
          the next day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Name one. Just one. They say, “Work hard, stay loyal, success will follow.” But can you
          name anyone who got truly rich just doing a 9-to-5? Not upper middle class. Not someone
          with a car and a loan. I mean wealthy. Independent. Free. You can’t. This system wasn’t
          made to reward you, it was made to use you. The real money is made by those who own other
          people’s time, not by those selling their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because to them, you weren’t a person. You were an asset. A number. A cow that gave milk:
          and when the milk ran out, so did your worth.

          <span>Paying Taxes, Getting Nothing in Return</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          Let’s talk about public services. The idea is simple: you pay taxes, and in return, the
          government is supposed to provide you with services that improve your life: better
          healthcare, quality education, a reliable transportation system, and proper
          infrastructure. But look around. How many times have you waited in long queues at
          government hospitals only to be told there are no beds or no medicine? How many schools
          are overcrowded, underfunded, with teachers who can barely get by themselves? Roads and
          public transport barely hold together, crumbling under the weight of neglect, while you
          continue paying taxes that supposedly fund these services.
        </p>
        <p>
          You walk into a government hospital with a sick family member, and you’re told there are
          no beds. Medicines? Out of stock. Cleanliness? Non-existent. You wait for hours just to be
          seen. In schools, you’re promised education, but the classrooms are overcrowded, the
          teachers are underpaid and demotivated, and the facilities are falling apart. Your
          children are told to dream big while sitting on broken benches with outdated books.
        </p>
        <p>
          You drive on pothole-filled roads that damage your vehicle, waste your time, and risk your
          life. You try taking a bus or train, and it’s either late, overcrowded, or falling apart.
          In an emergency, the system expects you to adjust, not the other way around.
        </p>
        <p>
          You pay for clean water, yet buy water cans because the taps at home deliver poison. You
          pay for electricity and still face blackouts. You pay for safety but feel unsafe walking
          home at night. You pay tax after tax: from income, GST, tolls, cess, and fuel: and still
          have to arrange everything on your own. Private hospitals, private schools, private
          security: because the public version has collapsed. The most basic utilities: water,
          electricity, sanitation, waste disposal: are either missing or broken. These are the
          things your taxes are supposed to cover, yet you end up paying twice: once to the
          government, and again to private providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don’t see the returns on what you contribute. You don’t get the luxury of comfort or
          the peace of mind that your needs are taken care of. Instead, you’re stuck in a system
          where your hard-earned money is diverted to things that don’t reach you. The politicians,
          the corporations, and those at the top continue to live their lives in comfort, while the
          system is only there to serve those already in power, not the people who built this
          country with their own hands. They take from you, and they give back little or nothing in
          return.
        </p>
        <p>Your taxes don’t build your future. They maintain their empire.</p>
        <div class="section-divider">
          <span>You're Like A Fucking Rabbit Who Breeds For Them</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          You’ve spent your life working, paying taxes, doing your part, while the government takes
          what it can. But what does it give back? Nothing. It’s like paying alimony to a divorced
          wife who doesn’t even care about you anymore. You give and give, but nothing comes back:
          just empty promises and empty hands. You’re stuck in a cycle, supporting a system that
          doesn’t give a damn about you. It drains you, then leaves you to struggle on your own. And
          what do you do? You get married, have kids, and teach them the same broken system, passing
          on the same false hopes, while they too become pawns in this never-ending game. They’ll
          keep the cycle alive, just like you did.
        </p>
        <p>
          They want you quiet. Exhausted. Constantly busy. Confused. So you never ask the hard
          questions. So you don’t see what’s being taken from you. So you just keep giving: until
          there’s nothing left.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know what the real problem is? You still don’t get it. You’re just reading this, not
          understanding. You think you're in control, but you’re not. You’re a modern slave paying
          taxes. Surviving for yourself. You’re just a modern slave in a modern society, fooled into
          thinking you run the world. But you don’t. You’re cargo, just cargo, delivering yourself
          from point A to point B, thinking it chose the route. You don’t run the world; you’re just
          their tool to make the rich richer.
        </p>
        <p>It convinces you that survival is living, and that living is rebellion.</p>
        <div class="section-divider">
          <span>Am I The Only One Who’s Awake?</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          Sometimes I fucking wonder if I’m the last real human left. Everyone else? NPCs with dead
          eyes and fake smiles. Programmed to wake up, work, eat, scroll, sleep: repeat. No
          questions, no rage, no soul. It’s like walking through a graveyard of warm bodies. How the
          fuck are they not losing their minds? How do they not see they’re slaves in a cage dressed
          up like freedom? Either they’re fucking blind… or they love the damn leash.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a world that breaks so many, I choose to keep my smile and kindness; not because it’s
          easy, but because it’s all I have.
