        <span>Just a Father and His Child Bonding</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        Ever thought about your dad as a child? Yes, he was a child too. Ever wondered why he goes
        through so much to provide for your demands? And he completes them without question: not as
        a responsibility, but love.
      </p>

      <p>
        You give that big wide smile when you get what you asked for, that sparkle in the eyes: and
        as boy, I'll be honest, we're suckers for it. Maybe he remembers being a kid too, asking his
        own father for small things, and now he smiles to himself when he sees you do the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he gets his anger out on you, remember it's not you but something happened at work
        place or maybe in train or maybe it was a small build-up of stress, somewhere. Just cut him
        some slack and don't talk back on him, he'll realize it when he cools down.
      </p>

      <p>
        He might not say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù every day, but he shows it every time he quietly fixes a
        problem before you even know it existed. And all he ever asks for in return is that smile.
        That one smile that makes it all worth it.

      <div class="section-divider">
        <span>You Were Never Meant to Be Rich</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        You spent 30, maybe 40 years of your life in that company, day in and day out, gave them
        your youth, your energy, your health: Then why aren‚Äôt you rich? Why don‚Äôt you have the
        luxury you once dreamed of: the nicer car, the bigger house, the freedom? the vacation home,
        the designer clothes? Shouldn‚Äôt loyalty pay off? Shouldn‚Äôt sacrifice come back around?
      </p>

      <p>
        But no, the system was never designed to make you rich. It was designed to use you like a
        cow: quiet, consistent, replaceable. The milk is your effort, your time, your sweat: and to
        them, that milk is profit. They gave you just enough to keep you working, fed you promises
        to keep you hopeful, and expected you to keep producing.
      </p>

      <p>
        They never planned to let you live well: they planned to use you well. Promotions? Just
        things to dangle in front of you to keep you going. Benefits? Just enough to stop you from
        getting tired or quitting. And when you can‚Äôt work anymore, they don‚Äôt thank you. They don‚Äôt
        honour you. They give you a small pension, maybe a handshake, and forget about you the next
        day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Name one. Just one. They say, ‚ÄúWork hard, stay loyal, success will follow.‚Äù But can you name
        anyone who got truly rich just doing a 9-to-5? Not upper middle class. Not someone with a
        car and a loan. I mean wealthy. Independent. Free. You can‚Äôt. This system wasn‚Äôt made to
        reward you, it was made to use you. The real money is made by those who own other people‚Äôs
        time, not by those selling their own.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because to them, you weren‚Äôt a person. You were an asset. A number. A cow that gave milk:
        and when the milk ran out, so did your worth.

        <span>Paying Taxes, Getting Nothing in Return</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        Let‚Äôs talk about public services. The idea is simple: you pay taxes, and in return, the
        government is supposed to provide you with services that improve your life: better
        healthcare, quality education, a reliable transportation system, and proper infrastructure.
        But look around. How many times have you waited in long queues at government hospitals only
        to be told there are no beds or no medicine? How many schools are overcrowded, underfunded,
        with teachers who can barely get by themselves? Roads and public transport barely hold
        together, crumbling under the weight of neglect, while you continue paying taxes that
        supposedly fund these services.
      </p>

      <p>
        You walk into a government hospital with a sick family member, and you‚Äôre told there are no
        beds. Medicines? Out of stock. Cleanliness? Non-existent. You wait for hours just to be
        seen. In schools, you‚Äôre promised education, but the classrooms are overcrowded, the
        teachers are underpaid and demotivated, and the facilities are falling apart. Your children
        are told to dream big while sitting on broken benches with outdated books.
      </p>

      <p>
        You drive on pothole-filled roads that damage your vehicle, waste your time, and risk your
        life. You try taking a bus or train, and it‚Äôs either late, overcrowded, or falling apart. In
        an emergency, the system expects you to adjust, not the other way around.
      </p>

      <p>
        You pay for clean water, yet buy water cans because the taps at home deliver poison. You pay
        for electricity and still face blackouts. You pay for safety but feel unsafe walking home at
        night. You pay tax after tax: from income, GST, tolls, cess, and fuel: and still have to
        arrange everything on your own. Private hospitals, private schools, private security:
        because the public version has collapsed. The most basic utilities: water, electricity,
        sanitation, waste disposal: are either missing or broken. These are the things your taxes
        are supposed to cover, yet you end up paying twice: once to the government, and again to
        private providers.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don‚Äôt see the returns on what you contribute. You don‚Äôt get the luxury of comfort or the
        peace of mind that your needs are taken care of. Instead, you‚Äôre stuck in a system where
        your hard-earned money is diverted to things that don‚Äôt reach you. The politicians, the
        corporations, and those at the top continue to live their lives in comfort, while the system
        is only there to serve those already in power, not the people who built this country with
        their own hands. They take from you, and they give back little or nothing in return.
      </p>

      <p>Your taxes don‚Äôt build your future. They maintain their empire.</p>

      <div class="section-divider">
        <span>You're Like A Fucking Rabbit Who Breeds For Them</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        You‚Äôve spent your life working, paying taxes, doing your part, while the government takes
        what it can. But what does it give back? Nothing. It‚Äôs like paying alimony to a divorced
        wife who doesn‚Äôt even care about you anymore. You give and give, but nothing comes back:
        just empty promises and empty hands. You‚Äôre stuck in a cycle, supporting a system that
        doesn‚Äôt give a damn about you. It drains you, then leaves you to struggle on your own. And
        what do you do? You get married, have kids, and teach them the same broken system, passing
        on the same false hopes, while they too become pawns in this never-ending game. They‚Äôll keep
        the cycle alive, just like you did.
      </p>

      <p>
        They want you quiet. Exhausted. Constantly busy. Confused. So you never ask the hard
        questions. So you don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs being taken from you. So you just keep giving: until
        there‚Äôs nothing left.
      </p>

      <p>
        You know what the real problem is? You still don‚Äôt get it. You‚Äôre just reading this, not
        understanding. You think you're in control, but you‚Äôre not. You‚Äôre a modern slave paying
        taxes. Surviving for yourself. You‚Äôre just a modern slave in a modern society, fooled into
        thinking you run the world. But you don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre cargo, just cargo, delivering yourself
        from point A to point B, thinking it chose the route. You don‚Äôt run the world; you‚Äôre just
        their tool to make the rich richer.
      </p>

      <p>It convinces you that survival is living, and that living is rebellion.</p>

      <div class="section-divider">
        <span>Am I The Only One Who‚Äôs Awake?</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Sometimes I fucking wonder if I‚Äôm the last real human left. Everyone else? NPCs with dead
        eyes and fake smiles. Programmed to wake up, work, eat, scroll, sleep: repeat. No questions,
        no rage, no soul. It‚Äôs like walking through a graveyard of warm bodies. How the fuck are
        they not losing their minds? How do they not see they‚Äôre slaves in a cage dressed up like
        freedom? Either they‚Äôre fucking blind‚Ä¶ or they love the damn leash.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a world that breaks so many, I choose to keep my smile and kindness; not because it‚Äôs
        easy, but because it‚Äôs all I have.
