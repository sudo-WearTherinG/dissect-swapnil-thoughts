        <p>
          I know how people look at me, how their eyes judge without saying a word: thinking I’m
          just another spoiled, rich kid who doesn’t need to work. I’ve seen those eyes everywhere I
          go. It’s easy to make assumptions, but truth isn’t always what it seems. They don’t know
          my past at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          They don’t see the weight I carry. They don’t get what it’s like to be raised in something
          that broke you and then be expected to live as if it didn’t. They don’t understand what it
          feels like to be detached from a world that runs on patterns and scripts everyone else
          follows. I prefer to be alone, surrounded by my songs, or playing with little kids:
          because, deep down, I know I’ll never have the chance to have my own child.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watch as people chase money, status, attention, and followers, hoping it will fill the
          void inside. But I’m simply not interested in that. It’s not the path I want to follow.
          Instead, I chase after bonds and true connections: something deeper and more meaningful.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this world, I exist somewhere in the closed placed. I don’t need the noise, the rush,
          the endless struggle of life to feel like I fit into a world that wasn’t made for me. I
          watch and I observe, but I don’t engage. I’ve learned that it’s better to stay out of the
          game than to play by someone else’s rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was never meant to live like a machine. I came here, studied how humans live, the
          patterns, the roles, the noise. That part’s done. Now I’m drawn to what exists beyond this
          loop, not as escape, but out of curiosity. I don’t feel human. I stopped feeling human the
          moment I saw the system for what it is. I don’t feel humans either.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t desire what they chase, not money, not status, not lifestyle, or their staged
          celebrations. Birthdays, housewarmings, New Year’s, Diwali, Holi, Christmas, they repeat
          them like rituals scripted long ago, never questioning, never changing. The same scenes,
          the same noise, year after year. Their highs feel hollow to me, just chemical illusions
          sold as joy. And their gods? They run to them with complaints and prayers, but I’ve never
          felt moved to kneel. I study, but I don’t belong.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one would’ve seen this side of me, the one who questions everything, who doesn’t follow
          the crowd, who doesn’t need validation or the comfort of others. But I’m not concerned
          with what people think of me, because it’s only a shadow of who I really am. Still, I find
          myself reshaping my personality to meet the needs of others, just to feel like I belong
          here, even though I have no true desire to connect with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve played out everything in my head: from birth to where life takes us. Every
          conversation, every decision, every reaction, already played out in my mind. I’m not
          interested in experiencing it all by myself; it feels boring and predictable. Even though
          it’s not always 100% accurate, the conversations people have are mostly the same, just
          repeating patterns. It’s like I’m always a step ahead, anticipating what will happen
          before it even does. The thrill is gone when you already know the outcome. Even in my own
          mind, I’m still learning, still adjusting, trying to find balance, but the excitement of
          discovery feels lost and empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next part is something I can’t just share openly. It’s tied to my past, to the parts
          of me that made me who I am. It's the truth beneath everything: the reason I am the way I
          am. This isn’t something everyone should know, only those who’ve been there, who’ve seen
          the unspoken side. If you’ve ever truly understood me, you’ll know what this is about.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if we’ve shared a real conversation, whether in person or through a social media app,
          I know you can unlock it. It’s not just one password; there are multiple, each for those
          who’ve meant more than a fleeting connection. If you’ve been a true friend, then you’ve
          earned the right to see what lies behind this lock.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I’ll just sit here, silent, still, on this old bench where the world keeps walking
          past. I don't need to be seen. I just needed to know I was here.
        </p>
        <p>The world never noticed when I sat down. I doubt it will notice when I leave.</p>
        <p>
          After all the noise, the fights, the silence; I’m still here, still myself, still chasing
          what no one else sees.
        </p>

        I don’t belong here, and I stopped trying to.
        They read my thoughts, then vanished
        like honesty was some kind of threat.
        I speak in questions they can’t answer.
        I share truth, and they call it discomfort.
        Maybe I was never built for this species.
        Not broken. Just elsewhere.
