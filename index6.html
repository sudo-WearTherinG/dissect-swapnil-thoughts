      <p>
        I know how people look at me, how their eyes judge without saying a word: thinking I’m just
        another spoiled, rich kid who doesn’t need to work. I’ve seen those eyes everywhere I go.
        It’s easy to make assumptions, but truth isn’t always what it seems. They don’t know my past
        at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        They don’t see the weight I carry. They don’t get what it’s like to be raised in something
        that broke you and then be expected to live as if it didn’t. They don’t understand what it
        feels like to be detached from a world that runs on patterns and scripts everyone else
        follows. I prefer to be alone, surrounded by my songs, or playing with little kids: because,
        deep down, I know I’ll never have the chance to have my own child.
      </p>

      <p>
        I watch as people chase money, status, attention, and followers, hoping it will fill the
        void inside. But I’m simply not interested in that. It’s not the path I want to follow.
        Instead, I chase after bonds and true connections: something deeper and more meaningful.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this world, I exist somewhere in the closed placed. I don’t need the noise, the rush, the
        endless struggle of life to feel like I fit into a world that wasn’t made for me. I watch
        and I observe, but I don’t engage. I’ve learned that it’s better to stay out of the game
        than to play by someone else’s rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was never meant to live like a machine. I came here, studied how humans live, the
        patterns, the roles, the noise. That part’s done. Now I’m drawn to what exists beyond this
        loop, not as escape, but out of curiosity. I don’t feel human. I stopped feeling human the
        moment I saw the system for what it is. I don’t feel humans either.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t desire what they chase, not money, not status, not lifestyle, or their staged
        celebrations. Birthdays, housewarmings, New Year’s, Diwali, Holi, Christmas, they repeat
        them like rituals scripted long ago, never questioning, never changing. The same scenes, the
        same noise, year after year. Their highs feel hollow to me, just chemical illusions sold as
        joy. And their gods? They run to them with complaints and prayers, but I’ve never felt moved
        to kneel. I study, but I don’t belong.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one would’ve seen this side of me, the one who questions everything, who doesn’t follow
        the crowd, who doesn’t need validation or the comfort of others. But I’m not concerned with
        what people think of me, because it’s only a shadow of who I really am. Still, I find myself
        reshaping my personality to meet the needs of others, just to feel like I belong here, even
        though I have no true desire to connect with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve played out everything in my head: from birth to where life takes us. Every
        conversation, every decision, every reaction, already played out in my mind. I’m not
        interested in experiencing it all by myself; it feels boring and predictable. Even though
        it’s not always 100% accurate, the conversations people have are mostly the same, just
        repeating patterns. It’s like I’m always a step ahead, anticipating what will happen before
        it even does. The thrill is gone when you already know the outcome. Even in my own mind, I’m
        still learning, still adjusting, trying to find balance, but the excitement of discovery
        feels lost and empty.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next part is something I can’t just share openly. It’s tied to my past, to the parts of
        me that made me who I am. It's the truth beneath everything: the reason I am the way I am.
        This isn’t something everyone should know, only those who’ve been there, who’ve seen the
        unspoken side. If you’ve ever truly understood me, you’ll know what this is about.
      </p>

      <p>
        But if we’ve shared a real conversation, whether in person or through a social media app, I
        know you can unlock it. It’s not just one password; there are multiple, each for those
        who’ve meant more than a fleeting connection. If you’ve been a true friend, then you’ve
        earned the right to see what lies behind this lock.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I’ll just sit here, silent, still, on this old bench where the world keeps walking past.
        I don't need to be seen. I just needed to know I was here.
      </p>

      <p>The world never noticed when I sat down. I doubt it will notice when I leave.</p>

      <p>
        After all the noise, the fights, the silence; I’m still here, still myself, still chasing
        what no one else sees.
      </p>

  I don’t belong here, and I stopped trying to.  
  They read my thoughts, then vanished—  
  like honesty was some kind of threat.  
  I speak in questions they can’t answer.  
  I share truth, and they call it discomfort.  
  Maybe I was never built for this species.  
  Not broken. Just elsewhere.  
  Still breaking my quetions with logic.
